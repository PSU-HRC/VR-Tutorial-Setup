# VR-Tutorial-Setup
### VR Controlls only supported with Windows OS!!! Mac users can still open and contribute to the Unity project, they just won't be able to test the VR controls. The purpose of this repository is to help you get started in your first VR project. This project is already set up so that all you have to do is install the Unity files and you'll be able to immediately test out the VR game. However, video references will be linked at the bottom if you want to see the step-by-step making of this project.
We will be using a Meta Quest 2 and Unity to implement VR controls into our club's 3D printed InMoov Humanoid Robot. Unity is an extremely popular game engine which utilizes C# to write scripts for game development, as well as libraries and packages to create the game environement itself. Of these libraries, there are also some that provide support for Virtual Reality capabilities, which is what we will be researching and experimenting with as we learn how to collect data from the Meta Quest, create algorithms to manipulate that data as we need, use APIs to send that data to our Arduino microchips, and eventually have full control of our robot.
